# Cursor Rules for Sigma Project

## Go Development Rules

### Use `go run` instead of building binaries
- Always use `go run sigma.go` or `go run .` instead of `go build` followed by running the binary
- This avoids creating build artifacts and keeps the development workflow cleaner
- Example: Use `go run sigma.go game.siq` instead of `go build && ./sigma game.siq`

### Code Style
- Follow Go conventions and formatting
- Use `gofmt` for code formatting
- Prefer explicit error handling over ignoring errors

### Project Structure
- Keep the main application logic in `sigma.go`
- Use the `siq` package for SIQ file handling
- Store documentation in the `docs/` directory
- Use `data/` for any data files

### Testing
- Use `go test ./...` to run all tests
- Write tests for new functionality in the `siq` package
